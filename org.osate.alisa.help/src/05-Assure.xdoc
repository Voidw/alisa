chapter:Assure[Assurance Results]

The e[Assure] notation is used to represent assurance results for an assurance case.
Assurance results files are automatically generated from an assurance case specified in an e[Alisa] file.
The generated file has the extension e[assure] and is placed in the e[assure] folder.

At this time users will open the file in the editor. The outline view will allow the user to execute the assurance task instance and show the assurance results.
