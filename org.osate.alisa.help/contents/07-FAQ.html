		<em>Q:</em> How do I refer to identifiers that are the same as keywords?
		 
		 <em>A:</em> You use the escape character &apos;^&apos; to prefix an identifier. This will tell the parser to interpret
		 it as identifier rather than a keyword. This is a useful feature since Alisa and its different langauges
		 have a rich set of keywords. Note: this escape character is used in the Xbase expression language.
