<h1>Assurance Results</h1>
<p>
The <em>Assure</em> notation is used to represent assurance results for an assurance case.
Assurance results files are automatically generated from an assurance case specified in an <em>Alisa</em> file.
The generated file has the extension <em>assure</em> and is placed in the <em>assure</em> folder.
</p>
<p>
At this time users will open the file in the editor. 
The outline view will allow the user to execute the assurance task instance and show the assurance results.
</p>
<p>
The <em>assure</em> representation maintains the state of verification activities, preconditions, and validations as well as the cumulative
state for individual claims as well as all claims for a system. The following <em>assure result</em> objects
are maintained:
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>assurance evidence:</em> the assurance results for a system, i.e., all its claim results, as well
		as  assurance evidence for any subsystem that is part of a given assurance plan.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>claim result:</em> the calim results for a requirement of a system, i.e., all its verification activity
		results,
		any subclaims. The verification activities are executed, and their results evaluated according to the
		argument expression specified as part of the claim.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>verification activity result:</em> the result of executing a verification activity. A verification
		activity may have preconditions that must be satisfied to be executed. The verificationa
		ctivity result validity may be determined by a <em>validation activity</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Precondition/validation result:</em> the result of executing a precondition/validation activity.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>andthen/failthen/unknownthen result:</em> the result of one of these expression operators.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A verification activity, precondition, and validation has <em>execution state</em> and <em>result
state</em>.
</p>
<p>
The execution state has the following values:
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>todo:</em> verification activity is to be executed
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>running:</em> execution of the verification activity is in progress
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>completed:</em> execution is complete with results
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>redo:</em> a verification activity, whose execution is in progress, must be re-executed due to user
		changes. When the execution completes the state transitions to <em>todo</em>.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The result state has the following values:
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>tbd:</em> the result value is to be determined by executing the verification activity. In the viewer
		this state is shown as <em>[T]</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>success:</em> the verification activity completed and the evaluated predicate returned a positive
		result. In the viewer
		this state is shown as <em>[S]</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>fail:</em> the verification activity completed and the evaluated predicate returned a negative result.
		In the viewer
		this state is shown as <em>[F]</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>unknown:</em> the verification activity did not complete, thus, the result is unknown. It may not
		have completed because it exceeded the alloted time (see <em>timeout</em> limit in verification activity),
		or because the execution itself failed, e.g., the verification method crashed or threw an exception.
		In the viewer
		this state is shown as <em>[U]</em>.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Verification, precondition, validation activity result objects also have a record of any issues, i.e.,
error, warning, or info messages providing explanation of the results, in particular if the verification activity fails.
</p>
<p>
The cumulative assurance state tracks various counts:
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>success count:</em> the number of successful verification activities contained in the given assure result.
		In the viewer this count is shown as <em>S#</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>fail count:</em> the number of failed verification activities contained in the given assure result.
		In the viewer this count is shown as <em>F#</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>unknown count:</em> the number of verification activities with unknown results contained in the given assure result.
		In the viewer this count is shown as <em>U#</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>tbd count:</em> the number of verification activities contained in the given assure result whose results are TBD.
		In the viewer this count is shown as <em>T#</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>andthen skip count:</em> the number of <em>andthen</em> expressions contained in the given assure result,
		whose left-hand side was unsuccessful, thus, the right-hand side got skipped. In the viewer this count is shown as <em>AS#</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>fail/unknown count:</em> the number of <em>failthen</em> and <em>unknownthen</em> expressions contained in the given assure result,
		whose left-hand side was unsuccessful. In the viewer this count is shown as <em>FU#</em>.
	</li>
</ul>
